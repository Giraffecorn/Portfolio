                <h3> How I got into Coding</h3>
                <p> I got into coding when I was in 7th grade when I took a PLTW class that was over coding.
                    We got to code a lot of fun apps and games, and I really enjoyed doing it.
                    That's how I got into coding and wanted to persue it in my future.

                <h3>What I like to do in my free time.</h3>
                <p> In my free time, I like to play my Violin. My favorite piece that I have played so far would probably be Berlioz's "March to the Scaffold.
                    I also like to watch Youtube videos over various topics just to learn a little bit on the topic.
                    The topic of the videos can range from math, medical, or anything educational to gaming and just having a fun time watching it.
                </p>
